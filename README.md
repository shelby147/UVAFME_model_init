# UVA Forest Model Enhanced: Initialization version
This repository holds the source code for UVAFME and pre- and post-processing scripts for figures and data in Sundquist _et al. in review_. 

UVAFME is an individual-based forest gap model which simulates the establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees on independent gaps or "plots" of a forested landscape.

For more information about UVAFME visit the [UVAFME website](https://uvafme.github.io/) and GitHub repository for the [previous version](https://github.com/UVAFME/UVAFME_model/) of the model.

Please contact [Shelby Sundquist](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5379-0008) at ss3988@nau.edu with any questions. 

Model input and output data and raw and intermediate data products are available upon request.
