TSVF input scripts

Expect to edit directories at the top of scripts as needed 

1) Run summarize_init_strata.Rmd to summarize data from Alaska State Forestry inventories for use in initialization files. Snapshotted data backed up in raw/
2) Parameterize input files for all sites with TSVF_500m_inputs.Rmd. This file has instructions to run other scripts and programs for intermediate data products. Requires installation of ClimateNA v7.31 and data from Alaska DNR. Snapshotted data backed up in raw/. Read comments between code blocks for further instructions. 
3) Run BatchScripting.R to separate GCM data and sitelists by units. This reduces computation time when you run the model because the model runs through however long the climate GCM input is many times, and it's LONG.
4) Run CreateSlurmScripts.R to create slurm scripts
5) Navigate to jobDir from CreateSlurmScripts.R. Slurm calls are in slurmcalls.txt and ready to be pasted into terminal.
