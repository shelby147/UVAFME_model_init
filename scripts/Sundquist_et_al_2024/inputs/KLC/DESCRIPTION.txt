These files create UVAFME inputs to initialize forests over Canada from Landsat products

Workflow: 
ExploreLandsatSpeciesDat.R crops Landsat rasters to KLC tile. These files are massive so this step has already been performed and the tile data is in raw/
SSDtest_inputs.Rmd creates inputs to develop species-level stem size distributions during different stand phases
StandPhaseExploration.R summarizes UVAFME stand size distribution outputs into species and stand phase level parameters and outputs these. 
Write_landsat_init_files2.R uses Landsat products and UVAFME output (for stem size distribution) to create initialization input files on a 1km grid
Landsat_1km_inputs.Rmd creates input files to run UVAFME with initialized forests on a 1km grid. Read instructions in Rmd
spinup_inputs.Rmd creates spinup inputs (this was done by hand for TVSF but with a script for KLC)
