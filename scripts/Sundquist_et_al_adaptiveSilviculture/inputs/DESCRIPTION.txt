1) Run summarize_init_strata.Rmd to summarize data from Alaska State Forestry inventories for use in initialization files. Snapshotted data backed up in raw/

Requires installation of ClimateNA v7.31 and data from Alaska DNR. Snapshotted data backed up in raw/. Read comments between code blocks for further instructions. 
3) Run BatchScripting.R to separate GCM data and sitelists by units. This reduces computation time.
4) Run CreateSlurmScripts.R to create slurm scripts
5) Navigate to jobDir from CreateSlurmScripts.R. Slurm calls are in slurmcalls.txt and ready to be pasted into terminal. 

6) TVSF_sitelevel_bspflists.R creates inputs for site_mgmt runs
